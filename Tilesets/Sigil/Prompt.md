Please create, in javascript, a 5*5 grid of 80px tiles of tiles using any number of SVG images from an `escutcheon` folder. The images should be loaded randomly.

Clicking or hovering any tile should update it randomly with any SVG image from a `tincture` folder.

The grid should be wrapped in a div whose width and height can be easily specified with % or px. Round the corners of the grid to 8px. There should be no gaps between the tiles, and their corners should not be rounded.

Finally, the javascript and the css should be inlined in the html file.
